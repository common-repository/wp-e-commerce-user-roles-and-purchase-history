== Description ==\
\
WP e-Commerce User Roles and Purchase History\
\
This Plugin allows Administrators using WP e-Commerce 3.8 to apply roles to their users. Currently the Plugin supports 3 default roles; Customer Role, Product Manager Role and Store Manager Role.\
\
The Customer Role will be applied to anybody that buys something from your shop, they get no extra capabilities however their purchase history will display with all their account information on their profile page. This feature also makes it mush easier for the site admins to differentiate Customers from other WordPress users.\
\
If other existing users purchase from your store (eg subscribers) then their user account will also be added to the customer count and the role applied.\
\
The Product Manager role will allow the user to edit and add new products, categories and variations. They won't be able to see the sales logs or change any store settings.\
\
The Store Manager will get full access to all WP-e-Commerce Plugin menus including store sales and store settings.\
\
The administrator role is still required for the site admin to be able to edit all other aspects of the WordPress install.\
\
Please note WP e-commerce 3.8 is required this won't work on any previous versions.\
\
== Installation ==\
\
1. Upload `wpec_user_roles` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\
3. If you jump over to your administrator users menu you will no be able to apply the extra capabilities to your users.\
4. If you have already sold items through your store then you will notice that the users customer link already has some users under it.\
